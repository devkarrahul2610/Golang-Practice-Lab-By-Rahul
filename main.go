// A map in go is inbuild datastructure used to store key-value pairs.Its like a dictionary- you use a key to quickly lookup a value.
//Keys must be unique and hashable.Maps use hashing for fast access, so lookup,insert and delete operations are usually constant time.
//Maps are referance type. If you pass map to a function, changes affects the original. Maps are very usefuls in senarios like counting
// occurances,indexing data and grouping related information.
